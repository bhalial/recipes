Ingredients:

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 1 cup water
- Optional: vegan chocolate chips, fresh fruit or berries for topping

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan.

2. In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.

3. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, white vinegar, and water until smooth.

4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.

5. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the surface with a spatula.

6. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.

7. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. Slice and serve your vegan chocolate cake as desired, and enjoy!
