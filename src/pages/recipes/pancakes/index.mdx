<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup non-dairy milk (such as almond milk or soy milk)
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the non-dairy milk and apple cider vinegar. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes to curdle.

Add the vegetable oil and vanilla extract to the milk mixture and whisk to combine.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix, as this can lead to tough pancakes.

Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop the batter and pour it onto the pan.

Cook the pancake for 2-3 minutes on one side until bubbles form on the surface. Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until cooked through.

Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat as needed to prevent burning.

Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or vegan whipped cream.

<h3>Enjoy your delicious vegan pancakes!</h3>
