Ingredients:

- 2 cups maize meal (also known as cornmeal or polenta)
- 4 cups water
- 1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
- Vegan butter or margarine (optional)

Instructions:

1. In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.

2. Slowly whisk in the maize meal, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.

3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes or until the mixture has thickened.

4. Add salt to taste and continue to stir for another 5 minutes, or until the pap has reached your desired consistency. It should be smooth and creamy.

5. Remove from heat and let it sit for a few minutes to thicken further.

6. If desired, stir in a few tablespoons of vegan butter or margarine for added richness.

7. Serve hot as a side dish or a main meal with your favorite vegan stew, sauce, or vegetable curry.

8. Enjoy your delicious vegan South African pap!
