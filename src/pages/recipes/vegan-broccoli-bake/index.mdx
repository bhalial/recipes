Ingredients:

- 1 head of broccoli, cut into florets

- 1/2 cup vegan sour cream
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon onion powder

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the vegan mayonnaise, vegan sour cream, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, onion powder, and dried oregano. Stir until well combined.

3. Add the broccoli florets to the mixing bowl and stir until they are fully coated in the sauce.

4. Transfer the broccoli and sauce mixture to a baking dish.

5. Bake the broccoli in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender and the sauce is bubbly and slightly browned on top.
